# BMI calculator

In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI.

Measurements to use:

1. Weight(kgs)

2. Height(m)

Formula:

BMI = Weight/(Height * Height)


We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is Overweight, normal or Underweight.




## Results:


If BMI > 24 then the person is Overweight



If BMI is between 18 and 25, the person is Normal



If BMI < 18 then the person is Underweight
